My_teleop package is a package that moves the robot in the stage simulation:
- In the keyboard_teleop.launch, we linked the node for movements with the correct topic /cmd_vel then visualised the rqt_graph  
- Then we introduced a python node in the package 'justmovebitch.py' that moves the robot automaticly
